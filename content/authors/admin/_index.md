      - Building [Jimy](https://gitar.ai/blog/introducing-jimy), the first AI coding agent which leverages deep static analysis and source code-level optimization algorithms to **scale agentic AI to massive enterprise codebases while minimizing hallucinations**.
      - Leading the AI research team on designing and implementing techniques for **bridging core compiler algorithms with generative AI** in Jimy. 
      - Architected and implemented static analysis technologies for **automated code refactoring solutions** for enterprise clients, including multiple **Fortune 500 companies**.

    summary: |
      - Built a new generation of **intelligent package managers** for JavaScript and Python based on combining **deterministic constraint solving algorithms** with **generative AI** to automatically fix common developer issues, such as solving runtime errors, patching security vulnerabilities and reducing code size.

      - Supervised and guided an undergraduate student ([Federico Cassano](https://federico.codes)) in building a **distributed system** using **relational databases** and **container orchestration** to archive every **NPM** package (over 36 million, 20+ TB) with low-latency (<1 min) within a large (50,000 CPU core) **high-performance computing** (HPC) cluster. 
      
      - Developed a novel eval methodology (MultiPL-E) to standardize the **evaluation of large language model (LLM) code generation** across 19 programming languages, which is used extensively by researchers at **Hugging Face**, ServiceNow, IBM Research and SAP.

      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I'm building the next generation of AI-driven developer tooling, and developing techniques for agents to perform long-running and complex code migrations across enterprise-scale codebases.
